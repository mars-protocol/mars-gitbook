# High Leverage Strategies

High Leverage Strategies (HLS) are specialized Credit Accounts with restricted collateral and debt pairings. Risk is isolated to the specific strategy, limiting collateral and debt to highly correlated asset pairs. A common implementation is using Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) as collateral against their underlying asset debt, such as dATOM collateral with ATOM debt.

The correlation between paired assets enables higher leverage ratios compared to standard Credit Accounts while maintaining system stability.
