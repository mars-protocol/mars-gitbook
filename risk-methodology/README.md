# Risk Methodology

To safeguard the system and user funds, Mars applies a rigorous, data-driven **risk assessment framework** developed by **Mars Protocol Foundation** and executed by the [**Mars Protocol Governance**](../governance.md).

This framework is designed to balance **capital efficiency** with **robust risk mitigation**, using both traditional finance tools and DeFi-native insights.

***

### Risk Framework Overview

The [**Mars Risk Framework**](mars-risk-framework.md) is a structured process used to evaluate:

* **New protocol integrations**
* **Asset listings** (standard tokens and LP tokens)
* **Risk parameters** (e.g., LTVs, borrow caps, liquidation thresholds)

Originally developed for **Mars v2**, the framework incorporates **international best practices** while addressing the unique volatility, decentralization, and oracle dependence of DeFi.

### Risk Assessment Tools

Mars combines traditional and crypto-native tools to quantify asset risk:

| Metric Type        | Description                                                           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TradFi Metrics** | Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), Amihud Illiquidity Measure          |
| **DeFi Metrics**   | Oracle reliability, smart contract security, decentralization scoring |

All assets are scored along a **risk spectrum**. Higher-risk assets are assigned more **conservative parameters** to mitigate systemic risk.

***

### Two-Phase Evaluation Process

1. **Technical & Centralization Risk Assessment**
   * Smart contract safety
   * Governance design and decentralization
   * Oracle dependency
   * Bridge and protocol integration reliability
2. **Market & Liquidity Risk Modeling**
   * On-chain liquidity depth and trading volume
   * Slippage sensitivity
   * Asset volatility
   * Establishes LTVs, liquidation thresholds, and caps

***

### Governance and Oversight

* The **Mars Protocol DAO** is responsible for applying this framework.
* Risk parameters can be **updated over time** as asset performance, liquidity, or market conditions evolve.
