# Depositing into Vault

### Finding a Vault&#x20;

All available vaults are listed in a **sortable table** on the main **Vaults page**.

Each row displays:

* **Vault Title** – The custom name set by the manager
* **Manager Identity** – Either a profile name (if set via Stargaze) or a shortened address
* **TVL** – Total value locked in the vault
* **APY** – Current annualized return (based on vault performance)
* **Fee** – The performance fee charged by the manager
* **Vault Info** – A button to inspect the vault in detail

> You can **sort** the list by TVL, APY, or fee to find vaults that match your risk appetite or yield target.

Click the **Vault Info** button to view full details, including strategy, past performance, and deposit options.



### Inspecting a Vault

Before depositing, you should always review the vault’s:

* **Strategy description** – Understand what the manager is doing with your funds.
* **Health & Position Metrics** – Includes leverage, risk level, open positions, and exposure.
* **Performance tab** – Shows historical data such as:
  * Vault balance
  * Share price evolution
  * Historical APY
  * Vault age
  * Max 90-day drawdown - largest value drop over any 90-day period
  * Total PnL - total profit or loss generated since vault inception

> ⚠️ Not&#x65;**:** Vault managers take a **performance fee**, which is a cut of the profits they generate. You can see the fee percentage on the vault’s summary panel.



### DYOR (Do Your Own Research)

Always make informed decisions. Take time to:

* Understand the strategy
* Review the manager’s trading history and transparency
* Check vault risk metrics
* Consider the withdrawal freeze period (lockup time)



### Depositing Funds

When you're ready to deposit:

* Funds are pulled **directly from your connected wallet**
* Your **Credit Account is not involved**
* In return, you receive **vault shares**, which are:
  * Proportional to your deposit
  * **Transferable**
  * Redeemable later for the base asset



### Withdrawing Funds

To exit a vault:

1. Click **Unlock** to start the withdrawal timer
2. After the **freeze period ends**, you can click **Withdraw**

> If you have **multiple unlocked positions**, clicking **Withdraw** will process **all of them in a single transaction**.



### My Vault Position

Once you've deposited into a vault, you'll gain access to a detailed breakdown of your personal position via the **Performance tab**. This section helps you track how your share in the vault has evolved over time.

Here’s what you’ll see:

*   **Your Balance**\
    The current value of your vault shares, denominated in the vault’s base asset (e.g., USDC or NTRN).

    > This value fluctuates based on both the vault’s performance **and** the market price of the base asset.\
    > For example, if the vault is denominated in NTRN, your balance in USD terms may change even if your share count stays the same — due to changes in NTRN’s price.
* **Total PnL**\
  The cumulative profit or loss generated by your position in the vault.
*   **ROI (Return on Investment)**\
    Expressed as a percentage, this shows your personal performance since the time of deposit.

    > For example, if you deposited $500 and your balance is now $550, your ROI is +10%.
* **Vault Share %**\
  Shows how much of the total vault you currently own.\
  This is determined by the number of vault shares you hold versus the total vault share supply.



> **Reminder:**\
> Managed Vaults are not entirely “set and forget.” You’re still responsible for monitoring your position over time.\
> Keep an eye on the vault’s strategy, positions, and risk metrics — especially if market conditions change.\
> While vault managers trade on your behalf, you should stay informed and reassess your deposit if needed.



### My Deposits

Any vaults where you have a deposit will appear in a separate **“My Deposits”** table at the top of the main Vaults page. This makes it easy to keep track of all your positions across different strategies.
