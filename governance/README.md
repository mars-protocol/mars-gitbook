# Governance

The Mars Protocol governance process enables the community to propose, discuss, and implement changes in a structured and transparent manner. It consists of **two to three stages**, depending on the type of proposal.

### Step 1:  Proposal Draft on Forum

Anyone—including Mars Protocol contributors - must start by posting a proposal draft on the [Mars Protocol Forum](https://forum.marsprotocol.io/)&#x20;

* **Purpose:** Open community discussion and feedback.
* **Duration:** Must remain open for **at least 3 days**.
* **Requirement:** A proposal can only move forward if there is **clear consensus on its feasibility and rationale**.



### Step 2: On-Chain Voting via DAO DAO

Once a forum draft achieves consensus, it is submitted on-chain through the [Mars Protocol DAO DAO Governance Interface](https://daodao.zone/).

* **Voting Period:** 3 days.
* **Eligibility:** Only users who **staked MARS tokens prior to proposal creation** are eligible to vote.
* **Voting Options:**
  * Yes
  * No
  * Abstain

> Many proposals are **signaling-only**, meaning they express intent without automated execution. Others may include executable messages or require manual follow-up actions.

### Step 3 (Optional): Builders Multisig Execution

Some proposals, especially those involving smart contract changes, require manual execution by the **Mars Protocol Builders Multisig**.

* **Structure:** 5 Mars contributors with a **3-of-5 multisig**.
* **Responsibility:** Executing post-vote actions, such as:
  * Adjusting smart contract parameters
  * Broadcasting specific transactions

The Builders Multisig can only initiate the necessary on-chain actions, when a proposal has passed governance via DAO DAO.\
