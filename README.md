### Marketplace Balance

A well-functioning leverage protocol is built as a marketplace that balances the needs of two key user groups:

2. **Investors (Risk Reducers)**: Users looking for stable yields and risk-managed investment strategies.

Mars Protocol aims to create products that cater to both types of users:

* For Yield Opportunities Investors: Emphasis on better risk-adjusted returns.

By serving this diverse user base, Mars Protocol fosters a robust and dynamic DeFi ecosystem that benefits all participants.
