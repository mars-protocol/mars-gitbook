## Binding Provisions

### 1. Site overview

#### 1.1 About the Site

The Site aggregates and publishes publicly available third-party information about:

* the Mars Hub
* Mars Outposts
* the Mars Smart Contract Protocol;
* the Mars Smart Contract System;
* tokens that exist and have been or may be made available for withdrawal or “borrowing” by third parties known as “lenders” or “depositors” in connection with the Mars Smart Contract System;
* third-party smart contract systems that act as ‘borrowers’ in contract-to-contract (C2C) transactions of the Mart Smart Contract System
* the implied or express fair market prices of tokens, which may be denominated in terms of other tokens; transaction records relating to the Mars Smart Contract System.

The Site also offers interaction methods whereby the User can indicate a transaction the User would like to perform in connection with the Mars Smart Contract System (such as swapping one token for another).

When used in this way, the Site can generate a draft transaction message which the User can independently use in conjunction with a third-party wallet application or device to conduct transactions on Mars Hub or Mars Outposts.

#### 1.2 About Mars

The Mars Smart Contract Protocol is software source code freely licensed to the public, which provides a decentralized “credit” protocol through which tokens can be ‘loaned’ and ‘borrowed’, as well as a governance protocol which can govern deployed instances of such protocol. The Mars Smart Contract System is a copy of the Mars Smart Contract Protocol that has been compiled to bytecode and permanently associated with one or more specific public addresses on Mars Hub and Mars Outposts. Through a compatible third-party wallet application or device, Mars Hub Core Node or node compatible with a Mars Outpost, as applicable, any User may pay Mars Hub Validators or other validators on the appropriate blockchain system to operate and record the results of the Mars Smart Contract System in accordance with the User’s instructions, thus effectuating token transactions.

#### 1.3 Relationship to Mars Smart Contract System

The Site Operator does not own, operate or control Mars Hub, Mars Outposts or the Mars Smart Contract System. Using Mars Outposts, Mars Hub, or the Mars Smart Contract System does not require use of the Site. The Site aggregates and publishes publicly available information about the Mars Smart Contract System in a user- friendly and convenient format. Such information is also independently available from other sources—for example, a person may directly review Mars transaction history, account balances and the Mars Smart Contract System on a compatible block explorer for a Mars Outpost.

By combining publicly available information with the User’s interactions with the Site, the Site can draft standard transaction messages compatible with the Mars Smart Contract System which are designed to accomplish the User’s operational goals as expressed through the interactions. If the User so wishes, the User may broadcast such messages to Terra in order to initiate token transactions.

All draft transaction messages are delivered by the Site via API to a compatible third-party wallet application or device selected by the User after pressing the “Connect Wallet” (or similar) button on the Site. The User must personally review and authorize all transaction messages that the User wishes to send to Mars Hub, Mars Outposts or other blockchain systems; this requires the User to sign the relevant transaction message with a private cryptographic key inaccessible to the Site. The User-authorized message will then be broadcast to Validators through the wallet application or device and the User may pay a network fee to have the Validators apply the transaction message to the Mars Smart Contract System and record the results on the appropriate blockchain—resulting in a token transaction being completed on that blockchain.

The Site Operator and the Site are not agents or intermediaries of the User, do not store or have access to or control over any tokens, private keys, passwords, accounts or other property of the User, and are not capable of performing transactions or sending transaction messages on behalf of the User. The Site does not hold and cannot purchase, sell or trade any tokens. All transactions relating to the Mars Smart Contract System are effected and recorded solely through the interactions of the User with the respective Validators, who are not under the control of or affiliated with the Site Operator or the Site.

#### 1.4 Disclaimers and Disclosures

Important disclaimers and disclosures regarding the subject material of the Site can be found on the Mars Disclaimers/Disclosures article on Medium. You should familiarize yourself with these disclaimers and disclosures and conduct your own thorough due diligence into the Mars Smart Contract Protocol and Mars Smart Contract System before using the Site.

#### 1.5 Defined Terms

* “_$MARS_” means the Blockchain Tokens native to Mars Hub and the bonding, staking or delegation of which determines which Mars Hub Core Nodes have the ability to propose and validate new blocks on the Mars Hub blockchain.
* _“Mars Core Nodes”_ means, at each time, the internet-connected computers then running unaltered and correctly configured instances of the most up-to-date production release of Mars Hub client software (the reference implementation of the Mars Protocol at https://github.com/mars-protocol/hub).
* _“Mars Hub”_ means, at each time, the canonical blockchain and virtual machine environment of the Mars Hub ‘mainnet’, as recognized by at least a majority of the Mars Hub Validators then being operated in good faith in the ordinary course of the network. As of the date of these Terms, the Mars Hub mainnet is the network associated with ChainID ‘mars-1’.
* _“Mars Hub Validators”_ means, at each time, the Mars Core Nodes included in the active validator set for Mars Hub at such time. As of the date of these Terms, the Mars Hub Validators are the top 50 Mars Core Nodes eligible for the validator set (ranked by number of $MARS staked) (or if there are less than 50 Mars Hub Validators, such lesser number of Mars Hub Validators).
* _“Mars Outposts” means runtime instances of the Mars Protocol, or any part thereof, deployed to a blockchain system and approved or governed in whole or in part by the Martian Council._
* _“Mars Protocol” means the software code at_ https://github.com/mars-protocol/ _or any successor thereto expressly determined by the Martian Council to constitute or form a part of the “Mars Protocol”._
* _“Mars Smart Contract Protocol”_ means the source code at https://github.com/mars-protocol/.
* _“Mars Smart Contract System”_ means all blockchain-based runtime bytecodes (aka “smart contracts”) deployed to Mars Outposts, and includes, without limitation, the runtime bytecodes deployed to the Osmosis blockchain network.
* “_Martian Council_” means at each time, all persons holding $MARS that is staked with or delegated or bonded to Mars Hub Core Nodes in the active validator set for Mars Hub at such time and has the power to vote such $MARS on governance proposals in accordance with the Mars Protocol.
* _“Site”_ means the web site, web pages, web applications and information and software available at or accessible   through   the   URLs   [https://marsprotocol.io/](https://marsprotocol.io/),  [https://app.marsprotocol.io](https://app.marsprotocol.io/) or any sub-URL of any such URL and any other Mars-related website or web application maintained by the Site Operator.

### 2. Site Operator Discretion; Certain Risks of the Site

Each User hereby acknowledges and agrees and consents to, and assumes the risks of, the matters described in this Section 2.

#### 2.1 Content

Site Operator makes no representations or warranties as to the quality, origin, or ownership of any content found on or available through the Site. Site Operator shall not be liable for any errors, misrepresentations, or omissions in, of, and about, the content, nor for the availability of the content. Site Operator shall not be liable for any losses, injuries, or damages from the purchase, inability to purchase, display, or use of content.

#### 2.2 Token Lists and Token Identification

In providing information about tokens, the Site associates or presumes the association of a token name, symbol or logo with a specific smart contract deployed to one or more blockchain systems. In making such associations, the Site relies upon third-party resources which may not be accurate or may not conform to a given User’s expectations. Multiple smart contracts can utilize the same token name or token symbol as one another, meaning that the name or symbol of a token does not guarantee that it is the token desired by the User or generally associated with such name or symbol. Users must not rely on the name, symbol or branding of a token on the Site, but instead must examine the specific smart contract associated with the name, symbol or branding and confirm that the token accords with User’s expectations.

#### 2.3 User Responsibility for Accounts & Security

Users are solely responsible for all matters relating to their accounts, addresses and tokens and for ensuring that all uses thereof comply fully with these Terms. Users are solely responsible for protecting the data integrity and confidentiality of their login information and passwords or private keys for the Site or any wallet applications or devices used in connection with the Site. The compatibility of the Site with wallet applications and devices or other third-party applications or devices is not intended as, and you hereby agree not to construe such compatibility as, an endorsement or recommendation thereof or a warranty, guarantee, promise or assurance regarding the fitness or security thereof.

#### 2.4 No Site Fees; Third-Party Fees Irreversible

There are no fees or charges for use of the Site. Use of the Mars Smart Contract System and use of Mars Hub and Mars Outposts are subject to third-party transaction fees. The Site Operator does not receive such fees and has no ability to reverse or refund any amounts paid in error.

#### 2.5 Site Operator Has No Business Plan and May Discontinue, Limit, Terminate or Refuse Support for the Site or any Smart Contracts, Tokens or Pools

The Site is a free web application operated and maintained in the sole and absolute discretion of the Site Operator. The Site Operator assumes no duties, liabilities, obligations or undertakings to continue operating or maintaining the availability of the Site and may terminate or change the Site in any or all respects at any time. The Site Operator has no business plan or revenue model for the Site. The Site Operator does not have revenues or a viable long-term business plan or capital-raising plan, and may become unable or unwilling to fund the operational costs of the Site on a long-term basis or to fund the upgrade costs required to keep the Site up to date with current technologies.

The Site Operator has no obligation to ensure that the Site is a complete and accurate source of all information relating to the Mars Smart Contract System, Mars Hub, Mars Outposts or any other subject matter. The Site does not necessarily display all tokens that are available for trading in connection with the Mars Smart Contract System or Mars Hub or Mars Outposts. Even if the Site currently displays a particular token or token pair, the Site may discontinue tracking and publishing information about that token or token pair at any time, in the Site Operator’s sole and absolute discretion. In the event of such a discontinuation, Users may need to rely on third-party resources such as block explorers or Mars Core Nodes in order to get equivalent information, and, depending on the User’s level of expertise and the quality of such third-party resources, this may result in the User incurring financial losses due to delays or mistakes in processing information or transactions.

The Mars Smart Contract Protocol is available under a free open-source license, and the Site Operator does not have proprietary or exclusive rights in the Mars Smart Contract Protocol. It is possible that additional copies of the Mars Smart Contract Protocol or derivatives thereof will be deployed to Mars Outposts or other blockchain systems in the future by any person, resulting in the existence of multiple ‘Mars-branded’ smart contract systems. The Site Operator is under no obligation to publish information for all such copies of the Mars Smart Contract Protocol or to warn Users regarding the existence of such alternatives.

#### 2.6 Site Operator May Deny or Limit Access on a Targeted Basis

The Site Operator reserves the right to terminate or limit any person’s User status or access to or use of the Site at any time, without or without notice, as determined in the Site Operator’s sole and absolute discretion. Such terminations and limitations may be based on any factor or combination of factors, including a person’s identity, blockchain address, IP address, internet service provider, virtual provider network provider, metadata, browser software, device type, wallet application, wallet device, region of citizenship or residence or current location, or suspicion that User has engaged or intends to engage in any Prohibited Use.

#### 2.7 Site Operator May Cooperate with Investigations and Disclose Information

The Site Operator reserves the right at all times to cooperate with any governmental or law enforcement investigation or to disclose any information it deems necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, or to edit, refuse to post or to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, based on any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, in the Site Operator’s sole and absolute discretion.

#### 2.8 No Regulatory Supervision

The Site Operator and the Site are not registered or qualified with or licensed by, do not report to and are not under the active supervision of any government agency or financial regulatory authority or organization. No government or regulator has approved or consulted with the Site Operator regarding the accuracy or completeness of any information available on the Site. Similarly, the technology, systems, tokens and persons relevant to information published on the Site may not be registered with or under the active supervision of or be registered or qualified with or licensed by any government agency or financial regulatory authority or organization. The Site Operator is not registered as a broker, dealer, advisor, transfer agent or other intermediary.

#### 6.1 No Consequential, Incidental or Punitive Damages

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained on the Site, in these Terms, or in any other agreement or publication, Site Operator shall not be liable to any person, whether in contract, tort (including pursuant to any cause of action alleging negligence), warranty or otherwise, for any economic or other damages to any User or other person, including any special, incidental, consequential, indirect, punitive or exemplary damages (including but not limited to lost data, lost profits or savings, loss of business or other economic loss) arising out of or related to these Terms, whether or not Site Operator has been advised or knew of the possibility of such damages, and regardless of the nature of the cause of action or theory asserted.

#### 6.2 Disclaimer of Representations

The Site is being provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Site Operator is not making, and hereby disclaims, any and all information, statements, omissions, representations and warranties, express or implied, written or oral, equitable, legal or statutory, in connection with the Site and the other matters contemplated by these Terms, including any representations or warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability, usage, security, uptime, reliability, suitability or fitness for any particular purpose, workmanship or technical quality of any code or software used in or relating to the Site. User acknowledges and agrees that use of the Site is at the User’s own risk.

#### 6.3 No Responsibility for Tokens; No Guarantee of Uniqueness or IP

Site Operator has no responsibility for the tokens traded by Users on the Mars Smart Contract System or Mars Hub or Mars Outposts. Site Operator does not investigate and cannot guarantee or warrant the authenticity, originality, uniqueness, marketability, legality or value of any token traded by Users on the Mars Smart Contract System or Mars Hub or Mars Outposts, even if information about such token is available on the Site.

#### 6.4 No Professional Advice or Liability

All information provided by or on behalf of Site Operator is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as professional, accounting or legal advice. Users should not take or refrain from taking any action in reliance on any information contained in these Terms or provided by or on behalf of Site Operator. Before Users make any financial, legal, or other decisions involving the Site, Users should seek independent professional advice from persons licensed and qualified in the area for which such advice would be appropriate.

#### 6.5 Limited Survival Period for Claims

Any claim or cause of action a User may have or acquire in connection with the Site or any of the other matters contemplated by these Terms shall survive for the shorter of, and may be brought against Site Operator solely prior to: (a) the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable thereto; and (b) the date that is six months after the date on which the facts and circumstances giving rise to such claim or cause of action first arose.

#### 6.6 Third-Party Offerings and Content

References, links or referrals to or connections with or reliance on third-party resources, products, services or content, including smart contracts developed or operated by third parties, may be provided to Users in connection with the Site. In addition, third parties may offer promotions related to the Site. Site Operator does not endorse or assume any responsibility for any activities of or resources, products, services, content or promotions owned, controlled, operated or sponsored by third parties. If Users access any such resources, products, services or content or participate in any such promotions, Users do so solely at their own risk. Each User hereby expressly waives and releases Site Operator from all liability arising from User’s use of any such resources, products, services or content or participation in any such promotions.

User further acknowledges and agrees that Site Operator shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such resources, products, services, content or promotions from third parties.

#### 6.7 Certain Uses and Risks of Blockchain Technology

1. **Use of Blockchain Technology.** Site Operator or third parties may utilize experimental cryptographic technologies and blockchain technologies, including tokens, cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, “smart contracts,” consensus algorithms, voting systems and distributed, decentralized or peer-to-peer networks or systems in connection with the Site or systems about which the Site provides information. Each User acknowledges and agrees that such technologies are novel, experimental, and speculative, and that therefore there is significant uncertainty regarding the operation and effects and risks thereof and the application of existing law thereto.
2. **Certain Risks of Blockchain Technology.** The technologies relevant to the Site depend on public peer-to-peer networks such as Mars Hub and the Mars Outposts that are not under the control or influence of Site Operator and are subject to many risks and uncertainties. Such technologies include the Mars Smart Contract System, which (other than based on any multisignature arrangements which may be described in the [Mars FUD Bible](mars-fud-bible.md)) Site Operator has no ability to change, other than ceasing to display information about certain “smart contracts” or adding information about new “smart contracts”. Users are solely responsible for the safekeeping of the private key associated with the blockchain address used in connection with the Mars Smart Contract System. Site Operator will not be able to restore or issue any refund in respect of property lost or frozen due to loss of private keys or otherwise. If a User is not able to spend or use tokens due to loss or theft of the corresponding private key or otherwise, a User will be unable to enjoy the benefits of such tokens.
3. **Certain Risks of Smart Contract Technology.** Digital assets relevant to the Site depend on the Mars Smart Contract System or other smart contracts deployed to Mars Outposts or other blockchain systems, or on the Mars Hub, each of which may be coded or deployed by persons other than Site Operator. Mars Hub, Mars Outposts, and other blockchain systems, and, once deployed to a blockchain system, the code of smart contracts, including the Mars Smart Contract System, typically cannot be modified, or can only be modified in limited ways. In the event that the Mars Hub, Mars Outposts, Mars Smart Contract System or other smart contracts or blockchain systems are adversely affected by malfunctions, bugs, defects, malfunctions, hacking, theft, attacks, negligent coding or design choices, or changes to the applicable protocol rules, Users may be exposed to a risk of total loss and forfeiture of all relevant digital assets. Site Operator assumes no liability or responsibility for any of the foregoing matters.
4. **Asset Prices.** The fiat-denominated prices and value in public markets of cryptocurrencies and tokens (including $MARS) have historically been subject to dramatic fluctuations and may be highly volatile. As relatively new products and technologies, blockchain-based assets are not widely accepted as a means of payment for goods and services. A significant portion of demand for these assets is generated by speculators and investors seeking to profit from the short- or long-term holding of blockchain assets. The market value of any token may decline below the price for which a User acquires such asset through the Mars Hub, Mars Outposts or Mars Smart Contract System or on any other system. User acknowledges and agrees that the costs and speeds of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems such as the Mars Hub, Mars Outposts and Mars Smart Contract System are variable and may increase or decrease dramatically at any time, resulting in prolonged inability to access or use any tokens.
5. **Regulatory Uncertainty.** Blockchain technologies and digital assets are subject to many legal and regulatory uncertainties, and the Mars Hub, Mars Outposts, Mars Smart Contract System or any tokens could be adversely impacted by one or more regulatory or legal inquiries, actions, suits, investigations, claims, fines or judgments, which could impede or limit the ability of User to continue the use and enjoyment of such assets and technologies.
6. **Cryptography Risks.** Cryptography is a progressing field. Advances in code cracking or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers may present risks to blockchain systems, the Mars Hub, Mars Outposts, Mars Smart Contract System or tokens, including the theft, loss or inaccessibility thereof.
7. **Fork Handling.** Mars Hub, Mars Outposts, the Mars Smart Contract System, and all tokens may be subject to “forks.” Forks occur when some or all persons running the software clients for a particular blockchain system adopt a new client or a new version of an existing client that: (i) changes the protocol rules in backwards-compatible or backwards-incompatible manner that affects which transactions can be added into later blocks, how later blocks are added to the blockchain, or other matters relating to the future operation of the protocol; or (ii) reorganizes or changes past blocks to alter the history of the blockchain. Some forks are “contentious” and thus may result in two or more persistent alternative versions of the protocol or blockchain, either of which may be viewed as or claimed to be the legitimate or genuine continuation of the original. Site Operator may not be able to anticipate, control or influence the occurrence or outcome of forks, and does not assume any risk, liability or obligation in connection therewith. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Site Operator does not assume any responsibility to notify a User of pending, threatened or completed forks. Site Operator will respond (or refrain from responding) to any forks in such manner as Site Operator determines in its sole and absolute discretion, and Site Operator shall not have any duty or obligation or liability to a User if such response (or lack of such response) acts to a User detriment. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Site Operator’s possible and permissible responses to a fork may include: (i) honoring the Mars Hub, Mars Outposts, Mars Smart Contract System and tokens on both chains; (ii) honoring the Mars Hub, Mars Outposts, Mars Smart Contract System and tokens on only one of the chains; (iii) honoring the Mars Hub, Mars Outposts, Mars Smart Contract System and tokens in different respects or to a different extent on both chains; or (iv) any other response or policy or procedure, as determined by Site Operator in its sole and absolute discretion.  Each User assumes full responsibility  to independently remain apprised of and informed about possible forks, and to manage the User’s own interests and risks in connection therewith.
8. **Essential Third-Party Software Dependencies.** The Mars Hub, Mars Outposts, Mars Smart Contract System and other relevant blockchain systems and smart contracts are public software utilities which are accessible directly through any compatible node or indirectly through any compatible “wallet” application (such as the web browser plugin Keplr) which interacts with such a node. Interacting with the Mars Smart Contract System does not require use of the Site, but the Site provides a convenient and user- friendly method of reading and displaying data from the Mars Smart Contract System and generating standard transaction messages compatible with the Mars Smart Contract System. Because the Site does not provide wallet software or nodes for Mars Hub or Mars Outposts, such software constitutes an essential third-party or user dependency without which the Mars Smart Contract System cannot be utilized, and tokens cannot be traded or used.
