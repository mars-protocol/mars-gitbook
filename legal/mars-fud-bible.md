  The Mars Protocol FUD Bible aims to be a compilation of FUD (fear, uncertainty
  and doubt), disclaimers, disclosures, and other risk-oriented information
  regarding the Mars Protocol Ecosystem.

# Mars FUD Bible

It is intended to disclaim any legal obligations of Mars Ecosystem participants to one another and third parties and to serve as a guide to a range of potential risks, uncertainties, and adverse/negative facts that may be associated with Mars Protocol or its use or results of operation. It is highly recommended that you carefully study the Bible, go to church and say your prayers before directly or indirectly using Mars Protocol or $MARS or engaging in any other activities directly or indirectly related to the Mars Ecosystem.

Despite the Bible’s goals of serving as the primary resource for Mars Ecosystem FUD, it might not be a comprehensive account of all relevant risks, uncertainties, adverse/negative facts and disclaimers. DYOR, _caveat emptor_, etc. and so forth and so o&#x6E;_._

Beyond the Bible, you should also be aware of and consider reviewing the following sources of information relevant to the Mars Ecosystem:

* [the Mars Protocol software code](https://github.com/mars-protocol)
* [the Mars Protocol Docs](../)
* [the marsprotocol.io Terms of Service](terms-of-service.md)
* all relevant legal, technical and educational content pertaining to relevant third-party ecosystems, including those relating to Mars Outposts such as Osmosis and Neutron

### Technology Risks

**No Warranties Etc.**

Mars Protocol and all other relevant technologies are being provided on an as-is basis, without representation, warranty, insurance or indemnity, and that all participation is solely at your own risk.

**Irreversibility of Transactions and Lack of Remedies and Insurance for Damages.**

Blockchain transactions are, under normal conditions, irreversible. Any tokens you deposit into Mars-related smart contracts are subject to potential risk of permanent disablement, impairment, loss or forfeiture in the event of any exploits, bugs or malfunctions of the relevant smart contracts or the underlying blockchain itself, and no remedy will be available from any person due to any damages you may suffer in connection with your participation in the Mars smart contract system or use of any of the relevant technologies.

**Experimental Technology; Technical Risks; Independent Due Diligence Required.**

The technologies and assets involved in the Mars smart contract system are highly experimental and risky, have uncertain and potentially volatile value, and should be directly evaluated by experts in blockchain technologies before use. Use them solely at your own risk. You must not rely on any articles, summaries or published code audits as an accurate description or evaluation of the Mars smart contracts, or for purposes of making any financial or other decision. Instead, you must only participate in the Mars smart contract system after thoroughly reviewing and understanding the code of the relevant smart contracts in your own independent due diligence process.\
\
**Multisignature Controls Over Mars Smart Contract System**\
\
Certain elements of Mars technologies can be modified or controlled by a cryptographic  multisignature smart contract stored on their respective blockchains (the “Multisig”). The  Multisig, in turn, is administered by natural persons who each hold a private key, a subset of  which may (by signing their respective private keys to the same transaction and broadcasting  that transaction to blockchain validators) instruct validators to perform Multisig operations. It  is possible for the Multisig key holders, through the Multisig, to change certain parameters of  the Mars smart contracts or other Mars-related technologies. This discretion of the Multisig  key holders constitutes a material risk, and could enable your tokens to be adversely impacted,  lost, damaged, used in unexpected ways, subjected to unexpected risks, or misappropriated.  Additionally, the Multisig may be able to arbitrarily change smart contract code related to  Outposts on certain other blockchains, which could enable tokens on those blockchains to be  misappropriated if at least three of the Multisig key holders collude.

### Financial Risks

**Risks of Token Deposits and Locking.**

When you deposit any tokens into Mars-related smart contracts on an Outpost, you are committing such tokens to the sole and  absolute control of the applicable software systems until such time as you withdraw such  tokens from such smart contracts. Certain deposit  mechanisms may not allow for immediate withdrawal of tokens. \
\
If a lockup period or ‘un bonding’ period or other limit on withdrawals applies, you will not be able to withdraw tokens  until the applicable period expires. During the time your tokens are controlled by the  applicable software system, you will lose all powers over and benefits with respect to such  tokens, other than the specific uses that such code allows you to make of such tokens during  the deposit period, if any. You may lose financial opportunities, or the value of your tokens  may decline during such deposit periods. Depending on the exact technology and functions  involved, even systems that normally allow immediate withdrawals can impose withdrawal  delays or have withdrawals become unavailable, whether as a result of “liquidation events,” “illiquidity events”, “insolvency events,” “hacks,” “exploits,” or  otherwise—any such events may lead to partial or total financial loss of your tokens. &#x20;

**Risks of Red Bank Illiquidity Events and Insolvency Events.**

Mars Red Banks can become illiquid or insolvent.&#x20;

### Tax Risks

Choosing to receive any $MARS can have adverse tax consequences and result in financial losses net of taxes, depending on your circumstances and tax jurisdiction. \
\
Engaging in liquidity mining on Outposts or staking, or participation in the Martian Council on DAO DAO may have adverse tax consequences and result in financial losses net of taxes, depending on your circumstances.

### Risks of Mars Research, Development, Deployment, Maintenance, Etc.

#### Risks of No Promised Efforts or Resources.

The Mars Ecosystem is intended to be community-governed. After the public launch of Mars,  none of the persons who created all or any part of the Mars smart contract system should be  expected to have a material ongoing role in Mars research, development or promotion. Certain  relevant parties may elect to undertake limited ministerial activities directly or indirectly  related to Mars, such as maintaining availability of a Mars web interface, but no promise,  guarantee or assurance of such ministerial efforts or any other efforts is being made, and any  such efforts which do occur may be abandoned at any time, with or without advanced notice.  There is no ‘Mars enterprise’, ‘Mars company’ or ‘Mars business’ and there is no capital  dedicated to future Mars marketing, research, development or maintenance. &#x20;

No person or entity has promised you, or assumed any obligation to you to exert or provide  financial or other support for, any efforts, capital or resources in connection with the Mars  Protocol. No person or entity has promised you, or assumed any obligation to you to exert or  provide financial support for, any research, development, promotion, marketing, maintenance,  monitoring, or improvements relating to the Mars Protocol. There is no capital primarily,  exclusively, or irrevocably set aside or committed to funding any efforts, support or resources  in connection with the Mars Protocol. Any past, present or future efforts on the part of any  entity or person are being conducted on a voluntary and not committed basis, and are not  intended as, and must not be construed or relied upon as, a promise of continuing efforts. &#x20;

***

### Risks of Decentralized Governance.

Any smart contract parameter adjustments, network client updates, Outpost approvals, Vault  approvals, C2C Borrower approvals or other changes required to the Mars Protocol or any  instance thereof will require approval of the Martian Council, which consists of a dispersed  group of $MARS token holders that may be unable or unwilling to sufficiently coordinate to  produce action. &#x20;

***

### Risks of Builder $MARS Allocations.

Persons who contributed to the research and development of Mars Protocol have received 30% of the $MARS token supply, escrowed in a smart contract lockup.&#x20;

No such person has made any representation, promise, guarantee or assurance to you that any  $MARS granted to any such person, or any funding or resources of any such person, will be  held, used or spent for the benefit of the Mars community. &#x20;

Any sale or other transfer or distribution of such $MARS tokens could occur without warning.  Any such transaction would increase the circulating supply of $MARS tokens. Depending on  the number of $MARS sold, transferred, or distributed, the terms of sale, transfer or  distribution and the prevailing market conditions, such a sale, transfer or other distribution  could have a material adverse effect on the price or value of, or demand for, $MARS tokens.

While locked in the smart contract escrow, the $MARS builder tokens will be votable within  the Martian Council. Any use of such $MARS to vote in Mars governance could affect  governance outcomes. It cannot be guaranteed that any such $MARS token recipients will  participate in Mars governance. Any voting of $MARS builder tokens could fail to be  conducted on a reasonable, good faith, diligent, or disinterested basis and may not be done in  the best interests of other $MARS holders or the Mars community. Any $MARS holder could  have financial interests or other interests or incentives which could outweigh their respective  interests and incentives (if any) relating to Mars, and $MARS holders do not owe you  fiduciary duties or other legal duties which would preclude them from following such extrinsic  interests to the detriment of your interests or the interests of the Mars Ecosystem.&#x20;

$MARS holders who choose to participate in governance will be required to use their own  personal independent discretion and decision-making in doing so. No entity or other person  will have the right to direct, manage or control how other $MARS holders exercise their voting  powers. &#x20;

As a result of the foregoing factors and the lack of any person or group of persons able to  control and manage Mars, any discretionary decision-making related to Mars depends on the  effectiveness of spontaneous group decision-making among participating $MARS holders.  There may be disputes, differences of opinion, disagreements, conflicting incentives and a  lack of coordination among or between any or all governance participants, and such  circumstances may adversely affect governance results.

### Risks of Differences Between DeFi and TradFi

**Mars “Red Banks” Are Not Banks; No Regulations or Deposit Insurance Apply.**

Mars “Red Banks” are smart contracts and are not actually banks; use of the term “bank” is metaphorical. Deposits into the Red Bank are not insured by or through any deposit insurance scheme applicable to banks. Consumer lending laws, deposit maintenance requirements, solvency requirements and other banking regulations do not apply to Mars Red Banks.

**Metaphorical Use of Financial Terms; Lack of Legal Recourse for Funds.**

When used in connection with Mars, the terms ‘debt,’ ‘lend,’ ‘borrow,’ ‘collateral,’ ‘credit,’  ‘leverage,’ ‘bank,’ ‘borrow’, ‘yield,’ ‘invest’ and other similar terms are not meant to be  interpreted literally. Rather, such terms are being used to draw rough, fuzzy-logic analogies  between the heavily automated and mostly deterministic operations of a decentralized-finance  smart contract system, on the one hand, and the discretionary performance of traditional finance transactions by people, on the other hand. &#x20;

For example, ‘debt’ is a legally enforceable promise from a debtor to a creditor to pay an  interest rate and eventually repay the principal. Therefore, ‘debt’ cannot exist without legal  agreements and cannot be enforced without courts of law. By contrast, with Mars, there are  no legal agreements, promises of (re-)payment or courts of law, and therefore there are no  debts, loans or other traditional finance transactions involved in using Mars. &#x20;

Instead, Mars consists of software (including embedded game-theoretic incentives and  assumptions) through which people can share their tokens with other people or smart contract  systems and, under normal and expected conditions and subject to various assumptions  regarding the behavioral effects of incentives, probably get their tokens back eventually, plus  extra tokens, most of the time or in most cases. Unlike in traditional lending, the ‘lender’s’  financial return does not depend primarily on the creditworthiness, solvency or financial skill  of the ‘borrower’ or on legal nuances such as the perfection of liens or the priority of creditor  claims in a bankruptcy — it depends primarily on the incentive model assumed by the software  design and how reliably the software implements that model. &#x20;

Unlike a debtor, people who ‘borrow’ tokens from the Mars smart contract system are not  required to, and have not promised to, pay the tokens back. Therefore, if the ‘borrowers’ never  pay the tokens back, no promise has been broken, no legal agreement has been breached and  the token ‘lenders’ cannot sue the ‘borrowers’ to get their tokens back. Instead, by not  repaying the borrowed tokens, the token ‘borrowers’ merely demonstrate either that they  lacked sufficient incentive to want to do so — for example, because their smart-contract bound ‘collateral’ was worth much less than the ‘borrowed’ tokens — or that a technical issue  — such as congestion of the underlying blockchain — prevented them from doing so.  Regardless, the ‘borrowers’ do not have an obligation to repay tokens when they do not want  to or cannot do so, and there is no legal remedy available for damaged ‘lenders’ when  insufficient incentives or technical problems result in a token shortfall.&#x20;

When Mars is used to ‘lend’ tokens to a third-party smart-contract system, the situation is  even less like traditional debt: The ‘borrowing’ smart contract has not posted ‘collateral’ and  could malfunction or suffer a loss that results in complete or partial failure to return the  ‘borrowed’ tokens to the Mars smart contract system and its token ‘lenders’. In this case, the  token ‘lenders’ could suffer loss of tokens, but they will not have a legal remedy against the ‘borrowing’ smart contract or the Mars smart contract. Smart contracts are not persons, are  usually not under the full control of any person or group of persons and may be impossible to  repair, debug, update, pause or reverse. You should assume that a malfunctioning, exploited  or underperforming smart contract which is not under the discretionary control of a single  person or entity cannot be forced (in court or otherwise) to pay the ‘borrowed’ tokens back.&#x20;

The Mars protocol incentivizes $MARS holders to provide a potential partial remedy to token  ‘lenders’ when token ‘borrowers’ fail to pay their tokens back. The Mars Safety Fund can be used to partially or completely compensate Mars token ‘lenders’  who suffer shortfalls when token ‘borrowers’ fail to repay tokens or the value of ‘borrowers’’  liquidated collateral is too low. But, remember: the Mars Safety Fund, like the Mars credit  protocol, is merely a smart contract, not a person or insurance company — if the Mars Safety  Fund fails to provide $MARS to the damaged token ‘lenders’, or if $MARS have insufficient  monetary value to compensate for such damages, there has been no breach of a legal  agreement and the damaged token ‘lenders’ will not have a legal remedy.&#x20;

Any ‘rate,’ ‘APR,’ ‘APY,’ ‘yield,’ ‘interest rate,’ ‘ROI’ or other form of return stated in  connection with Mars for lending, borrowing, depositing, staking or otherwise transacting in  a given token, strategy or smart contract system, (the “Rate”) is denominated in terms of a  specific relevant token, not in terms of U.S. Dollars or other fiat currencies. Each Rate is a  forward-looking projection based on a good faith belief of how to reasonably project results  over the relevant period, but such belief is subject to numerous assumptions, risks and  uncertainties (including smart contract security risks and third-party actions) which could  result in a materially different (lower or higher) token-denominated ‘rate,’ ‘APR,’ ‘APY,’  ‘yield,’ ‘interest rate,’ or ‘ROI.’&#x20;

Rates are not offers, promises, agreements, guarantees or undertakings on the part of any  person or group of persons, but depend primarily on the results of operation of smart contracts  and other autonomous or semi-autonomous systems (including third-party systems) and how  third parties interact with those systems after the time of your deposit. Even if a particular  projected Rate is achieved, you may still suffer a financial loss in fiat-denominated terms if  the fiat-denominated value of the relevant tokens (your deposit and any tokens allocated or  distributed to you pursuant to the Rate) declines during the deposit period. Projected Rates are  not interest rates being paid on a debt.&#x20;

Thus, the transactions you can perform by using the Mars ‘credit protocol’, although they are  superficially similar to traditional financial transactions in some ways, are in fact very  different. ‘DeFi’ and ‘TradFi’ each pose their own unique set of costs, benefits, risks and  protection mechanisms. Please bear this fact in mind when reading about Mars, and do not  use Mars without a sufficient understanding of how doing so differs from traditional financial  transactions. The only way to fully understand such factors is to have a strong understanding  of the relevant technical systems and the incentive design mechanisms they embody — we  strongly encourage you to review Mars’s technical documentation and code before use.

### No Investment or Lending; No Contract Rights; Absence of Counterparties.

Your transactions utilizing the Mars smart contract are not intended to be an investment, a  capital-raising transaction for an enterprise, a sale of your tokens to any person or group of  persons or a purchase of $MARS from any person or group of persons. They are also not  intended to be a loan, consignment or deposit of your tokens to or with, or a service provided  to you by, any person or group of persons. \
\
There  is no ‘transaction counterparty’ or intermediary which has the discretionary power to reverse  your transactions or recover your tokens or other assets, or which has made you a promise to  return or refund any disabled, impaired, lost or forfeited assets. There is also no private or  governmental insurance (on the part of the creators of the Mars smart contract system, any nation-state or any other person) available to compensate you for any such  losses or other adverse circumstances relating to Mars transactions.&#x20;

***

### Lack of Governmental/Regulatory Oversight

Mars Protocol, the Red Bank, Credit Accounts, Perps and Vaults, $MARS and all related facts and  circumstances have not been reviewed, approved, endorsed or registered with any regulator  or other governmental entity. The creators of the Mars Protocol who operate  the Mars Protocol are not licensed by any regulator or other authority to provide any legal,  financial, accounting, investment or other advice or services.&#x20;
