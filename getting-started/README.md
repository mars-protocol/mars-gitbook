# Getting Started

To begin your journey with Mars Protocol, you'll need to create and fund your account with USDC or other supported assets. If you're coming from an EVM-compatible chain, USDC is the simplest and fastest option. You can transfer it from a centralized exchange (CEX) like Coinbase or any blockchain that supports native USDC.\
