# How to set up a Wallet

### Introduction

Welcome to the wallet setup guide! Since this is a Cosmos-based app, traditional EVM wallets (like MetaMask out of the box) are **not compatible**. Instead, you’ll need a Cosmos-compatible wallet. In this guide, we’ll focus on creating a new **Keplr** wallet from scratch. Keplr is a popular browser extension wallet for Cosmos networks and offers seamless integration with our app. By the end of these steps, you’ll have a Keplr wallet ready to connect.

If you prefer another Cosmos wallet, the general process is similar. Other supported options include:

* [**Leap**](https://www.leapwallet.io/)
* [**Cosmostation**](https://cosmostation.io/products/cosmostation_extension)
* [**MetaMask**](https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/leapwallet/metamask-cosmos-snap/) (via the Leap Cosmos Snap integration)

### Install the Keplr Browser Extension

1. **Open the Extension Store**
   * In Chrome or Brave, go to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore) and search for **“Keplr Wallet”**.
   * In Edge, enable “Allow extensions from other stores” in Settings, then visit the Chrome Web Store page for Keplr.
2. **Add to Browser**
   * Click **“Add to Chrome”** (or equivalent) and confirm any prompts.
3. **Verify Installation**
   * You should see the Keplr icon (a purple-blue “K”) in your extensions area.
