# Using a Credit Account

Introduction

In order to interact with Mars Protocol V2 and access all features (see [Credit Accounts](../credit-accounts.md)) you must first create a Credit Account.

***

## 1. Create & Fund an Account

If you don’t yet have a Credit Account, you’ll be taken straight to the **Create and Fund a Credit Account** page:

* **Optionally connect an EVM wallet** to deposit USDC from an Ethereum or L2 chain
* **Select your collateral assets**
  * Click **Select Assets +** to open the asset selector.
  * Whitelisted collateral appears at the top and non-whitelisted assets appear below (see the [Lending & Borrowing](../lending-and-borrowing.md) page).

* **Choose deposit amounts** and click **Fund Account**.
  * After confirming the on-chain transaction, you’ll be redirected back to the app and see your new Credit Account in the navbar:

## 2. Create Additional Accounts

To open more than one Credit Account:

1. Click the **Credit Account** dropdown in the navbar.

## 3. Manage Your Credit Accounts

Once you have one or more Credit Accounts, you can **Fund**, **Withdraw**, or **Delete** any of them from the same navbar dropdown:\
